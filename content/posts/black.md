Black 3.0 is the latest version of Stuart Semple’s super matte, ultra black acrylic paint.

It was created with the help of over 1000 different artists who beta-tested the paint. Thanks to the amazing support of the artistic community via Kickstarter we managed to fund the manufacture of this incredible paint (it was just too much for our little studio).

Black 3.0 is the blackest and mattest acrylic paint on the planet. Unlike other super-black coatings it can be safely applied with nothing more than a brush, and we’ve worked super hard to make it affordable.
